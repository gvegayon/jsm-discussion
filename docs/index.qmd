## Highlights @krivitskyTaleTwoDatasets2022

What I highlight in their paper:

- Start to finish framework for multi-ERG models.

- Dealing with heterogeneous samples.

- Model building process.

- Goodness-of-fit analyses.

Two important missing pieces (for the next paper): power analysis and how to deal with collinearity in small networks.

# Power analysis in ERGMs {background-color="#890000"}

## Sample size in ERGMs

Two different questions: *How many nodes?* and "*How many networks?*"

### Number of nodes (the usual question)

- Is the network bounded?

- If it is bounded, can we collect all the nodes?

- If we cannot collect all the nodes, can we do inference [@schweinbergerNoteRoleProjectivity2017;@schweinbergerExponentialFamilyModelsRandom2020]?

### Number of networks (not so usual)

- There is a growing number of studies featuring multiple networks (e.g., egocentric studies).

- There's no clear way to do power analysis in ERGMs.

- In funding justification, power analysis is fundamental, so we need that.

## A possible approach

::: {style="font-size: 90%"}

We can leverage conditional ERG models for power analysis.

- Conditioning on one sufficient statistic results in a distribution invariant to the associated parameter, formally:

  \begin{align}
  \notag\Prcond{\Graph = \g}{\s{\g}_l = s_l}  & = \frac{%
    \Pr{\s{\Graph}_{-l} = \s{\g}_{-l}, \s{\g}_l = s_l}
  }{%
    \sum_{\g'\in\GRAPH:\s{\g'}_l = s_l}\Pr{\s{\Graph} = \g'}%
  } \\ & =  %
  \frac{%
    \exp{\t{\coef_{-l}}\s{\g}_{-l}}
  }{%
    \normconst_{-l}
  }, \tag{1}
  \end{align}

  where $\s{\g}_l$ and $\coef_l$ are the $l$-th element of $\s{\g}$ and $\coef$ respectively, $\s{\g}_{-l}$ and $\coef_{-l}$ are their complement, and $\normconst_{-l} = \sum_{\g' \in \GRAPH: \s{\g'}_l = s_l}\exp{\t{\coef_{-l}}\s{\g'}_{-l}}$ is the normalizing constant.

- We can use this to generate networks with a prescribed edgecount (based on previous studies) and compute power through simulation.

## Example: Detecting gender homophily

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}
 
::: {.columns}

 Want to **detect an effect size of $\coef_{\mbox{homophily}} = 2$**, using conditional ERGMs (prev Eq.):

::: {.column width="65%" style="background-color: #f0f0f0; border-radius: 10px; padding: 10px;"}

 
1.  For each $n \in N \equiv \{10, 20, \dots\}$, do:


    a.   **Simulate**: $1,000$ sets of $n$ undirected networks of size 8 and 26 ties.

    b.   **Fit ERGM** Estimate $\widehat{\coef}_{\mbox{homophily}}$, and generate the indicator variable $p_{n, i}$ equal to one if the estimate is significant at the 95\% level.
  
    c.   **Compute empirical power** $p_n \equiv \frac{1}{1,000}\sum_{i}p_{n, i}$.


2.  **Model $n$ as a function of power** Using $\{p_{10}, p_{20}, \dots\}$, we can fit the model $n \sim f(p_n)$.


:::

::: {.column width="35%"}

Using KCH as a reference for density, we can fix the edge count to $0.93 \times 8 (8 - 1) / 2 \approx 26$

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| label: table
data.frame(
  Parameter = c("Network size", "Edge count", "$\\coef_{\\mbox{homophily}}$", "$\\alpha$", "$1 - \\beta$"),
  Value = c("8", "26", "2", "0.10", "0.80")
) |>
  knitr::kable()
```

<!-- Note that the **density** of the network is $\frac{20}{8 \times (8-1)} \approx 0.714$. -->

:::

Finally, the required sample size can be computed with $f(1-\beta) = f(0.80)$.

# Collinearity in ERGMs {background-color="#890000"}

## Not like in regular models

- Variance Inflation Factor [VIF] is a common measure of collinearity in regular models.

- Usually, VIF > 10 is considered problematic.

- VIFs are not straightforward in ERGMs:

    - Traditional models can feature completely exogenous variables.

    - ERGMs are by construction endogenous (`r alert("highly correlated")`).

    - It is expected that VIFs will be higher in ERGMs.

- @duxburyDiagnosingMulticollinearityExponential2021's large simulation study recommends using VIF between 20 and 150 as a threshold for multicollinearity.

- As small networks usually are denser, VIFs can be more severe.

## Predicting statistics

::: {style="font-size: 75%"}
- A directed network with 5 nodes, two of them female and three male.

- Two models: **(a) Bernoulli** (0.50 density) and **(b) ERGM(edge count, transitivity)** (0.92 density).

- When $\coef_{\mbox{ttriad}} = 0.75$ and $\coef_{\mbox{edges}} = -2$ (second row), Cor(transitive triads, mutual ties) $\to 1$, and VIF reaches 140 (mutual ties).

## Collinearity in small networks

::: {style="font-size: 80%"}

- In the same network, many combinations of model parameters yield $\rho\to 1$ and high VIFs.

- KCH's networks were highly dense, (0.93 and 0.73 for the household and egocentric samples, respectively.) $\rightarrow$ collinearity should be severe.

$\Graph \sim \mbox{ERGM}(\mbox{edgecount}, \mbox{mutual ties}, \mbox{transitivity})$

## Discussion

- Krivitsky, Coletti, and Hens' work make an important contribution to ERG models, most relevant: model building, selection, and GOF for multi-network models.

- Power (sample size requirements) and multicollinearity are two important issues that are yet to be addressed.

- I presented a possible approach to deal with power analysis in ERGMs using conditional distributions.

- Collinearity in small networks (like those in KCH) can be serious (more than in larger networks.) Yet we need to further explore this.

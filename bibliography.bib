  abstract = {The last two decades have witnessed considerable progress on founda-tional aspects of statistical network analysis, but less attention has been paid to the complex statistical issues arising in real-world applications. Here, we consider two samples of within-household contact networks in Belgium generated by different but complementary sampling designs: one smaller but with all contacts in each household observed, the other larger and more representative but recording contacts of only one person per household. We wish to combine their strengths to learn the social forces that shape household contact formation and facilitate simulation for prediction of disease spread, while generalising to the population of households in the region. To accomplish this, we introduce a flexible framework for specifying multi-network models in the exponential family class and identify the requirements for inference and prediction under this framework to be consistent , identifiable, and generalisable, even when data are incomplete; explore how these requirements may be violated in practice; and develop a suite of quantitative and graphical diagnostics for detecting violations and suggesting improvements to a candidate model. We report on the effects of network size, geography, and household roles on household contact patterns (activity, heterogeneity in activity, and triadic closure).},

These procedures compare structural statistics of the observed network with the corresponding statistics on networks simulated from the fitted model. We apply this approach to the study of friendship relations among high school students from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth). We focus primarily on one particular network of 205 nodes, although we also demonstrate that this method may be applied to the largest network in the AddHealth study, with 2,209 nodes. We argue that several well-studied models in the networks literature do not fit these data well and demonstrate that the fit improves dramatically when the models include the recently developed geometrically weighted edgewise shared partner, geometrically weighted dyadic shared partner, and geometrically weighted degree network statistics. We conclude that these models capture aspects of the social structure of adolescent friendship relations not represented by previous models. \textcopyright{} 2008 American Statistical Association.},

  abstract = {Exponential random graph models (ERGM) have been widely applied in the social sciences in the past 10 years. However, diagnostics for ERGM have lagged behind their use. Collinearity-type problems can emerge without detection when fitting ERGM, yielding inconsistent model estimates and problematizing inference from parameters. This article provides a method to detect multicollinearity in ERGM. It outlines the problem and provides a method to calculate the variance inflation factor (VIF) from ERGM parameters. It then evaluates the method with a Monte Carlo simulation, fitting 216,000 ERGMs and calculating the VIFs for each model. The distribution of VIFs is analyzed using multilevel regression to determine what network characteristics lend themselves to collinearity-type problems. The relationship between VIFs and unstable standard errors (a standard sign of collinearity) is also examined. The method is shown to effectively detect multicollinearity, and guidelines for interpretation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Statistical models for social networks have enabled researchers to study complex social phenomena that give rise to observed patterns of relationships among social actors and to gain a rich understanding of the interdependent nature of social ties and actors. Much of this research has focused on social networks within medium to large social groups. To date, these advances in statistical models for social networks, and in particular, of Exponential-Family Random Graph Models (ERGMS), have rarely been applied to the study of small networks, despite small network data in teams, families, and personal networks being common in many fields. In this paper, we revisit the estimation of ERGMs for small networks and propose using exhaustive enumeration when possible. We developed an R package that implements the estimation of pooled ERGMs for small networks using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE), called ``ergmito''. Based on the results of an extensive simulation study to assess the properties of the MLE estimator, we conclude that there are several benefits of direct MLE estimation compared to approximate methods and that this creates opportunities for valuable methodological innovations that can be applied to modeling social networks with ERGMs.},

  abstract = {Exponential-family Random Graph Models (ERGMs) constitute a large statistical framework for modeling sparse and dense random graphs, short- and long-tailed degree distributions, covariates, and a wide range of complex dependencies. Special cases of ERGMs are generalized linear models (GLMs), Bernoulli random graphs, {$\beta$}-models, \$p\_1\$-models, and models related to Markov random fields in spatial statistics and other areas of statistics. While widely used in practice, questions have been raised about the theoretical properties of ERGMs. These include concerns that some ERGMs are near-degenerate and that many ERGMs are non-projective. To address them, careful attention must be paid to model specifications and their underlying assumptions, and in which inferential settings models are employed. As we discuss, near-degeneracy can affect simplistic ERGMs lacking structure, but well-posed ERGMs with additional structure can be well-behaved. Likewise, lack of projectivity can affect non-likelihood-based inference, but likelihood-based inference does not require projectivity. Here, we review well-posed ERGMs along with likelihood-based inference. We first clarify the core statistical notions of "sample" and "population" in the ERGM framework, and separate the process that generates the population graph from the observation process. We then review likelihood-based inference in finite-, super-, and infinite-population scenarios. We conclude with consistency results, and an application to human brain networks},

  abstract = {This study shows that residual variation can cause problems related to scaling in exponential random graph models (ERGM). Residual variation is likely to exist when there are unmeasured variables in a model\textemdash even those uncorrelated with other predictors\textemdash or when the logistic form of the model is inappropriate. As a consequence, coefficients cannot be interpreted as effect sizes or compared between models and homophily coefficients, as well as other interaction coefficients, cannot be interpreted as substantive effects in most ERGM applications. We conduct a series of simulations considering the substantive impact of these issues, revealing that realistic levels of residual variation can have large consequences for ERGM inference. A flexible methodological framework is introduced to overcome these problems. Formal tests of mediation and moderation are also proposed. These methods are applied to revisit the relationship between selective mixing and triadic closure in a large AddHealth school friendship network. Extensions to other classes of statistical work models are discussed.},
